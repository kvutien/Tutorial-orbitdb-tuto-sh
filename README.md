*(Written in July 2021)*

This project is the simplest possible example of a decentralised database using IPFS + OrbitDB, usable from the console shell interface. A kind of "_Hello World_". 

![Demo overview](./demo-overview.png)

The next tutorial will add a blockchain backend and a React frontend interface to record the credentials of the entry. Doing so, we separate the immutable part --the credentials of the owner of the data-- from the mutable data itself. This is the basis principle of **Machu Picchu**, a collaborative open source initiative to improve the action of the humanitarians to assist the persons-in-need, by giving back the onwership of data to each person-in-need.

It is part of a series of tutorial articles intended to convince you, IT people working for humanitarians, that blockchain and decentralised programming is not so daunting and can lower your operating costs while bringing a lot of benefits. Join us in project *[Machu Picchu](https://kvutien-yes.medium.com/machu-picchu-how-the-blockchain-can-help-persons-in-need-8396820d13d1)*.

* shared low cost operations
* resilience to failures
* preservation of digital rights of the recipients who keep ownership of data
* easy collection of feedback from recipients
* coordination among all actors

In 2019, **Cash & Voucher Assistance** programmes accounted for **USD 5.6 Bn, double of 2016. Huge solvent market.**

To use this demo, simply follow the setup instructions below. To reproduce the coding yourself, follow the [coding tutorial](TUTO-1.md) (in progress).

## Setup
The setup instructions use the console utility (`Terminal.app`) from MacOS. The setup instructions are the same if you use Linux Ubuntu. 

Under Windows, it is strongly recommended to run a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for Windows and install a Ubuntu Virtual Machine inside it. Here is a YouTube video of 4 minutes, that can guide you through this double installation process: https://youtu.be/8mns5yqMfZk.
### Overall environment setup, using MacOS
This setup complements your configuration and serves many purposes, not only this "_HelloWorld_" demo.
* Install [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
* Install nodeJS via brew: `brew install node@14.17.0`  (this version of nodeJS is the last long term stable support)

### Setup this specific application, using MacOS
* In the console (`Terminal`), clone this repository
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kvutien/orbitdb-tuto-sh.git
    Cloning into 'orbitdb-tuto-sh'...

    remote: Counting objects: 100% (120/120), done.

$ cd orbitdb-tuto-sh
$
```
* install the dependencies
``` bash
$ npm install
    ...

    ...
    found 3 high severity vulnerabilities
    run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
$
```
* disregard the warnings. Run the demo by typing
``` bash
$ ipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment & node index.js
    [1] 28719
    Initializing daemon...
    go-ipfs version: 0.7.0
    Repo version: 10
    System version: amd64/darwin
    Golang version: go1.14.4
    Swarm listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001
    Swarm listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/4001/quic
    ...
    WebUI: http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui
    Gateway (readonly) server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080
    Daemon is ready

```
* your console will also display the output of the application
```
-> IPFS node connected
-> OrbitDB instance created
-> One pet animal created
 -> database value of "species" =  German Shepherd
 -> database value of "owner" =  myself
 ```

## What's next?
This _"Hello World"_ tutorial will be followed by another **Full Stack** tutorial that integrates the blockchain and frontend parts. It will share the core code with this tutorial.

To be complete, you have a [tutorial here](./TUTO-1.md) to guide you through the pieces of code and get acquainted to IPFS and OrbitDB programming. 

It is becoming easy to be a production Full Stack blockchain + IPFS programmer. Stay tuned.

## Side note on the API.md documentation in Orbit-db github
The API documentation would gain in clarity if it contains
https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/blob/main/API.md

1.    A short definition.
2.    A block with the correct syntax for using the method.
3.    A list of parameters the method accepts or requires.
4.    The return value of the function.
5.    An extended description.
6.    Examples of the methodâ€™s use.
7.    Other additional information.
